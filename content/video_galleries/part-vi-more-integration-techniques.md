There is a saying to the effect that it’s much easier to scramble an egg than to unscramble one. The process of finding the derivative of a function (that is, its instantaneous rate of change) is always the same. However, the same cannot be said for finding the integral of a function (that is, “unscrambling” its derivative in order to determine what the function is). In this part of our course, we introduce some special techniques for doing this.
